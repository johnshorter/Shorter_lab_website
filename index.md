# introducing the shorter lab

Our overarching goal is to establish a robust framework for individualized treatment strategies in endocrine, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders. By integrating GWAS and functional genomics with state-of-the-art pharmacogenetics, we aspire to refine treatment options, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce the societal burden of chronic diseases. In parallel, we will continue to foster a collaborative environment that includes training new scientists in bioinformatics, genetics, and translational medicine.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

A central aim of our research is to discover new mechanistic insights into disease etiology and then translate these insights into actionable strategies for patient care. By integrating genomics, epidemiology, and computational biology within a framework of personalized medicine, we aim to accelerate the translation of basic discoveries into improved patient outcomes.
